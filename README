This project focuses on various probabilistic decisioning strategies and ways to improve them.

Task 1- To implement discrete Bayesian Networks for answering any probabilistic queries
Task 2- Different Sampling strategies and ways to improve the structure
Task 3- To implement Gaussian discrete Bayesian Networks to support both discrete and continuous variables
